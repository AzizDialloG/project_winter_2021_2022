# README.md 

This repository contains two project files

### scikit-learn.ipynb

This notebook file uses the  scikit-learn algorithms.
The library used in this files are

### Numerical arrays.
import numpy as np

### Data frames.
import pandas as pd

### Plotting.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

### sklearn.
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.gaussian_process import GaussianProcessClassifier
from sklearn.gaussian_process.kernels import RBF
from sklearn import datasets

# implemented following three algorithms
# 1. K-Means clustering on the handwritten digits data
# 2. Linear Regression
# 3. Random Forest: Feature importances with a forest of trees

# scipy-stats.ipynb
